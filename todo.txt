We now list the users and their groups.

So, next you should be able to click on a user, and select if the user
is an admin and/or a user.

This should be enough to write the chapter.

Then, we'll add in a permission for each note, and admins can assign
permissions to users for notes. So, we'll see restricting viewing a
note based on what permissions the user has.
